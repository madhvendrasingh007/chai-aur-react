## 🎯 What This App Does

This is a simple counter application that allows you to:
- **Increment** the counter value by clicking "Add Value"
- **Decrement** the counter value by clicking "Remove Value"
- See the current counter value displayed on both buttons in real-time

## 🪝 Understanding React Hooks

### What are Hooks?
React Hooks are special functions that let you "hook into" React features. They allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without writing a class component.

### Why Do We Use Hooks?
Before hooks (pre-React 16.8), you needed class components to manage state. Hooks made it possible to:
- ✅ Use state in functional components
- ✅ Write cleaner, more readable code
- ✅ Reuse stateful logic between components
- ✅ Avoid the complexity of class components

### The `useState` Hook in Our Code

```javascript
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(15);
```

This line does several important things:

#### 🔍 Breaking it Down:

**`useState(15)`**
- This is a React Hook that creates a state variable
- The `15` is the **initial value** of our counter
- It returns an array with exactly 2 elements

**`[counter, setCounter]`** (Array Destructuring)
- `counter` - This is our **state variable** that holds the current value
- `setCounter` - This is a **function** that updates the counter value

#### 📊 What is `counter`?
- `counter` is a **state variable** that stores the current count value
- It starts with the value `15` (our initial state)
- Every time the component re-renders, `counter` will have the most up-to-date value
- You can think of it as a "memory" that React keeps track of

#### ⚙️ What is `setCounter`?
- `setCounter` is a **state setter function**
- It's the ONLY way to update the `counter` value properly in React
- When you call `setCounter(newValue)`, React will:
  1. Update the `counter` variable with the new value
  2. Re-render the component to show the updated value
  3. Update the UI automatically

#### 🔄 Why Use `setCounter` Instead of Direct Assignment?

❌ **Wrong Way:**
```javascript
counter = counter + 1; // This won't work!
```

✅ **Correct Way:**
```javascript
setCounter(counter + 1); // This triggers a re-render!
```

React needs to know when state changes so it can update the UI. Using `setCounter` tells React "Hey, something changed, please update the display!"

## 🔧 Code Breakdown

Let's examine the key functions:

### Add Value Function
```javascript
const addValue = () => {
  console.log('Adding value', counter);
  setCounter(counter + 1);
}
```
- Logs the current counter value to console
- Increases counter by 1 using `setCounter`
- React automatically re-renders the component with the new value

### Remove Value Function
```javascript
const removeValue = () => {
  console.log('Removing value', counter);
  setCounter(counter - 1);
}
```
- Logs the current counter value to console
- Decreases counter by 1 using `setCounter`
- React automatically re-renders the component with the new value

### The Buttons
```javascript
<button onClick={addValue}>Add Value {counter}</button>
<button onClick={removeValue}>Remove Value {counter}</button>
```
- Each button shows the current `counter` value
- When clicked, they call their respective functions
- The display updates automatically thanks to React's reactivity

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   ```bash
   # If using Git
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This downloads all the necessary packages including React and Vite.

3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open Your Browser**
   - The terminal will show you a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
   - Click the link or copy-paste it into your browser
   - You should see your counter app running!

5. **Start Experimenting!**
   - Click the "Add Value" and "Remove Value" buttons
   - Open your browser's developer console (F12) to see the console.log messages
   - Try changing the initial value from `15` to something else

### 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run preview` - Previews the production build locally

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

After understanding this code, you should know:

- ✅ What React Hooks are and why they're useful
- ✅ How `useState` works and how to use it
- ✅ The difference between state variables and regular variables
- ✅ Why we use setter functions instead of direct assignment
- ✅ How React automatically updates the UI when state changes
- ✅ How to handle user interactions with event handlers
- ✅ How to run a React project with Vite

## 🎉 Next Steps

Try these challenges to deepen your understanding:

1. **Add a Reset Button** - Create a button that sets the counter back to 0
2. **Add Boundaries** - Prevent the counter from going below 0 or above 100
3. **Change the Step** - Make the counter increase/decrease by 5 instead of 1
4. **Add Styling** - Make the buttons look more attractive with CSS
5. **Multiple Counters** - Create multiple independent counters on the same page
